# Build Your Own HTTP Server

[![Project Cover](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/http-server/9d3ddbb3-2c0b-425a-8476-e3b1e5f53eba)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)

> Starting point for building your own HTTP server in Python.

This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own HTTP Server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build an HTTP/1.1 server capable of serving multiple clients. Along the way, you'll learn about TCP servers, [HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html), and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to [codecrafters.io](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/smiling-goat-493044) to try the challenge.
